# A-robotic-Arm-Control
A robotic arm control using pic microcontroller 16f877a
I designed a robotic arm control system using the PIC16F877A microcontroller. This project involved programming the microcontroller to control the robotic arm's movements through Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) signals to servo motors. By using PWM, I was able to precisely control the position and speed of the servo motors, allowing for smooth and accurate movements of the robotic arm. This project enhanced my skills in microcontroller programming, PWM signal generation, and servo motor control.
